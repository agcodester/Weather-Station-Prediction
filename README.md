# Weather-Station-Prediction
I have worked on this Project during my IBM Course - "Machine Learning using Python" on Coursera

The Purpose of this Project is to use Machine Learning Technique - Density-Based Clustering(DBSCAN) to group weather stations of Canada which show the same weather condition.

Taking Data Visualization to the next level by using the 'mpl_toolkits' python library which helps us in plotting values on the world map. A preview of this is given below.
